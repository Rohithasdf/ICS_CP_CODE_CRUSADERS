This is a countdown timer that takes input for duration in seconds, minutes, and hours, and then displays the remaining time in the format HH:MM:SS. It also provides a special message when there's only a certain amount of time left.

Here are some instructions for the user:

1. Enter countdown duration in seconds: This is the number of seconds for the countdown timer.
2. Enter countdown duration in minutes: Additionally, you can specify a countdown duration in minutes.
4. Enter countdown duration in hours: If needed, you can specify a countdown duration in hours.

The program will then start the countdown and display the remaining time in the format HH:MM:SS. If there are no hours left and minutes are greater than zero with seconds equal to zero, a special message will be displayed: "Last [minutes] minutes left!!". Once the countdown reaches zero, it prints "Countdown Finished!" and exits.
